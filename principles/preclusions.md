# Humans are as (or more) likely to find evidence to fit a conclusion as they are to find conclusions that match the evidence.

## Discussion
Would a position held before evidence is presented be called a "preclusion"? This actually seems like a useful word for the lexicon, offering an important distinction. "Conclude" has "conclusion", "preclusion" and "preclude" mirrors that well. 

Why do people do that?
