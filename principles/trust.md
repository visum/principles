# Trust is the product of two things: percieved motive and percieved ability.

## Discussion
Motive: They say that trust is built over time. Because we can't read one another's minds, we have no way of knowing other people's motives, so we observe patterns of behavior over time and try to guess. Our perception of someone's motive is really a theory we develop and are constantly testing against what a person actually does. This is why consistency is so important. An inconsistent person is constantly forcing people to rewrite their theories of his or her motives.

Ability: Regardless of the purity of their intent, I don't trust toddlers to drive standard cars.

Attempts to destroy trust in an individual (such as in political messaging) try to undermine trust by presenting evidence of undesirable motives or incompetence.

## Additional Questions
What about delegated trust? I fly on airplanes controlled by pilots I've never met, because I trust regulatory mechanisims, the airlines, and capitalism to filter out untrustworthy pilots.

What is "implicit trust"?
