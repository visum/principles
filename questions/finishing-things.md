# Why do I have such a hard time finishing things I start?

I love ideas and get very excited about them. In most cases I have the skills to build what I think will be so exciting, but very often run out of interest before getting very far.

I have also noticed that I will start something and get sidetracked on some detail of the thing that has little bearing on the core of what I was excited about. I won't proceed until I get this lesser detail resolved.

For example, the purpose of this repo of principles is to have a place to record principles, and to record them. At some point, I decided that it would be cool to have a build script that parses the .md files, collects all of the principles together into static .json files for a search/browse page that you could use with Github Pages. I held off publishing the repo because I wanted to finish the search page, even though doing so got in the way of getting value out of the core thing I wanted to accomplish. Maybe this is related to the Minimum Viable Product idea. Maybe it is only another flavor of distraction.
