# Nothing I think I know is exempt from reexamination.

## Discussion
I prioritize knowing true things over just thinking I know them. To feel threatened by an indictment of what I say is true betrays a belief that my truths depend on me to support them.

This came to mind while listening to an audiobook production of Carl Sagan's _Cosmos_, in which a fair amount of time is invested disucssing the nature of science to continually question itself. This is evidently a good pattern for learning new things, especially as new perspectives bring opportunities to refine what we know. That the Sun rises in the East is not untrue, but it is more precise to say that the Earth rotates about its axis.
