# Humans are as (or more) likely to find evidence to fit a conclusion as they are to develop or accept conclusions that match the evidence.

## Discussion
When a person identifies with, or draws value from, an opinion, a threat to the veracity of the opinion is personal. He or she will tend to search for reasons to maintain the position, often excluding uncomfortable evidence.

Attachment to an idea feels good for a number of reasons, an important one being membership in the group that thinks it's a good idea.

Would a position held before evidence is presented be called a "preclusion"? This actually seems like a useful word for the lexicon, offering an important distinction. "Conclude" has "conclusion", "preclusion" and "preclude" mirrors that well.
