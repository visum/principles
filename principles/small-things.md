# There are no big things, only bundles of small things.

## Discussion
Solving big problems, achieving large accomplishments, going a long distance - none are done in one step. Achievement is the reward of the focused and disciplined who manage to pull off doing a bundle of small things that all lead in one direction.

Everyone does small things, but many of those things are unrelated or if they are related, apply to nothing of consequence. There is no reward for having spent a thousand cumulative hours looking for the bottom of your social media feed; that is an empty achievement. Distraction is a goal's mortal enemy.
