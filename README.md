# principles
A place to gather my principles as I discover and define them

## Why Principles?
A principle is abstracted truth, distilled and packaged for reuse in varying situations. In contrast to rules, which are concrete decisions made in advance and often without the benefit of context, principles are flexible and can guide decisions to problems that were not anticipated.

To me, a principle is an artifact of real learning. Facts and rules will tell you how something works, what it is, and how to use it. Principles, which emerge with experience and reflection, express _understanding_ as well as knowledge.

## Mutability
I do not intend that these principles won't ever change. Understanding is not quantized to simple on/off states, but comes in degrees through an iterative refining process. If you land on a principle here that you particularly like, then come back later to find it changed and empty of the meaning that made it speak to you, sorry. Dig it out of the git commit history if you need to, then maybe write it down in your own collection that represents your own perspectives and understanding.

## Attribution
I will do my best to note the supporting conditions around my discovery of each principle, including attribution for people and works which led me to it.
