# Achievement is the result of a habit of trading short-term gains for long-term gains.

## Discussion
In financial matters, deferring a benefit can mean not buying something, and that eventually results in being able to buy more things later. In other contexts, the trade is in time and kind. Deferring the benefit of another cookie results in a delayed benefit of better fittness.

The greatests benefits come from consistent, focused trades of things you want now for things you want later. It also helps to know what you want.

This is really a matter of prioritizing without the bias of time.

Sometimes, by reframing the trade, it may not feel like deferring a benefit at all. If you don't buy whatever shiny disposable thing you are thinking about right now, you get to keep your money. Instead of wasting time on a video game, enjoy an enlightening book. Healthy food is not always disgusting.
