# There are no small things, only pieces of big ones

## Discussion
Everything you do is part of something bigger. Focus is the ability to make those small things matter by being deliberate about what you do. A big-things discipline helps a craftsman see the value of individual decisions and contributions. In othe words, small decisions are going to happen, but you have to make them matter.

Raw materials have to be organized in useful ways. I am starting to think of a string of decisions as raw materials that have to similarly be organized into something worth having.
