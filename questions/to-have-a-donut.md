# How do I know if I should eat a donut or not?

Most of the time, when I eat a donut, I regret it. Sometimes, I don't. What are the different conditions between these two cases?

## Data
Today, I've had nothing for breakfast but some chocolate milk. I am hungry. There are donuts available. I am going to try one.
